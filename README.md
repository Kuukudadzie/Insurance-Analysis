# Insurance-Analysis
Data Description This dataset contains detailed information about insurance customers, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status and region. Having access to such valuable insights allows analysts to get a better view into customer behaviour and the factors that contribute to their insurance charges. By understanding the patterns in this data set we can gain useful insight into how age,gender and lifestyle choices can affect a person's insurance premiums. This could be of great value when setting up an insurance plan or marketing campaigns that target certain demographics. Furthermore, this dataset provides us with an opportunity to explore deeper questions such as what are some possible solutions for increasing affordability when it comes to dealing with high charges for certain groups?

In this project:
Imported dataset from my local computer by using pandas but this is the source of the original data https://data.world/bob-wakefield
Reading the data dictionary to understand more about the dataset
Cleaned, analyzed data from the dataset to know how many null rows
Used pandas library to filter out the specific information
Objectives:

Using age, sex and bmi to create an algorithm for assessing life insurance costs.
Predicting costs for certain patients based on their sex, age, bmi and region to help doctors decide what treatments work best financially for them.
Creating a cost calculator that takes into account the patientâ€™s age, sex, smoker status, region of residence and other factors to accurately predict the medical bills a person will pay in a year
